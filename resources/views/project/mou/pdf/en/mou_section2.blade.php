                <b> This registration obliges both parties to respect the following principles:</b>

                2-This document does not serve as a permission for NGOs to perform health activities. All NGOs

                and/or Essential Package of Hospital Services (EPHS) after obtaining the NOC and signing MoU
                with the Ministry.
                <br>
                6- If an NGO delivers a vertical program or focuses on certain components of BPHS/EPHS, they
                must obtain official permission from the leadership of the MoPH.
